      <p class="ptext">Bob likes eating pretzels, swimming and playing darts.  When i was younger my friends use to always say Bob is great give me a chocolate cake.  It really has no meaning but I still think about it all the time. This assignment was pretty tough and I realized that the hard part was starting before I learned the material.  I had something working and instead of starting over I worked on fixing the bad code. Lesson learned is that this is a lot like poker you have to learn when to cut your losses and walk away and try another hand.  I am sure if I would have started over I would have been done faster and had a better result.</p>
